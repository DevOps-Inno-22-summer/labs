## Ansible 1

In this lab you need to get familiar with a CD tool - Ansible. Then use it to deploy docker on newly created cloud VM. You will need it for your application deployment in the next lab.

0. Create a workspace for a development environment on cloud (recommended is AWS)

- Prepare .tf ﬁles.
- Use terraform fmt, terraform validate.
