## Best Practices

The blog [UNIT TESTING BEST PRACTICES](https://www.partech.nl/nl/publicaties/2020/03/10-unit-testing-best-practices#) by [Partech](https://www.partech.nl/nl/) provides us with some best practices that we should consider.

+ ADOPT A WELL-ORGANIZED TEST PRACTICE

+ NAME YOUR TEST WELL
  + Unit testing is more than ensuring production code works.
    + Save your test with the strategy being tested.

    + Save your test given the name of the environment under which itâ€™s being tested.

    + Save your test with the proposed behavior when the scenario is requested.

+ WRITE RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY UNIT TESTS

+ MAKE AUTOMATED UNIT TESTING A RULE

+ FOCUS ON SINGLE USE-CASE AT A TIME

+ MINIMAL ASSERTION PER TEST

+ UNIT TEST SHOULD BE ISOLATED  

+ TRULY UNIT, NOT INTEGRATION

+ AIM FOR 100% CODE COVERAGE

+ START USING HEADLESS TESTING IN THE CLOUD
