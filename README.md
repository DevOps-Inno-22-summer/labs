# Labs

## Introduction

Welcome to DevOps course labs. All labs are practical and will be built on each other. You will implement simple application, containerize it, implement simple tests, build CI/CD, collect metrics, logs, etc.

## Architecture

This repository contains master branch with introduction and one branch with instructions for each lab. 

## Rules

Each labs requires the participant to pass all previous labs, therefore participants are required **to submit each lab (and get at least 60% of max grade for each lab) to pass the course**.

Grading is based on PRs with your solutions to the corresponding branch of this repository. This repository is read-only for all participants, therefore to be able to create pull requests, a participant should fork this repository to his own workspace and solve labs there. It is recommended to build solution of lab N upon solution of lab N-1, so choose workflow in your fork of this repository wisely. Structure of your repository will not affect your grade, only state of your repository from which the PR is created will be checked and graded (state after last commit in your PR on corresponding lab).

### Recommended workflow

#### For the first lab
1. Fork this repository on your workspace
2. Checkout master branch
3. Complete lab1 tasks
4. Push the code to your repository
5. **UPD.** create new branch (called lab1_submission) from main
6. **UPD.** Create PR to lab1 branch on this repository from lab1_submission
7. Submit zip to moodle
8. Wait for your grade

#### For all other labs
1. Checkout the commit where you finished the previous lab
2. Complete tasks of current lab
3. Push the code to your repository
4. **UPD.** create new branch (called labN_submission) from main
5. **UPD.** Create PR to labN branch on this repository from labN_submission
6. Submit zip to moodle
7. Wait for your grade


## Grading 

### Points distribution for the course

```
70 - labs
30 - final exam
```

### Grade ranges

```
[90;100] - A
[75;90)  - B
[60;75)  - C
[0;60)   - D
```

### Labs grading

Each lab is marked out of 10. All labs have a set of main tasks and a set of extra tasks. 

Completing main tasks correctly will give you 10 points out of 10. Completing extra tasks correctly will give you N (depends on the complexity of extra tasks) additional points. Your points for main and extra tasks will be summed and cut to 10 if you have more than 10. Basically, extra points will allow you to get max points even if some main tasks are not finished correctly, but will not give you more points for the course.

## Deadlines and labs distribution

Participants will be provided 2 labs simultaneously and have 1 week to submit solutions. Moodle will contain presentations and deadlines. 

**UPD.** You are required to submit zip file with your source code to corresponding assignment in moodle. This is required for the university as proof of work.

### Late submission policy

Submitting results after the deadline will result in maximum of 6 points for the corresponding lab. As stated before, all labs must be submitted to pass the course. 

- `Flask` is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and  features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file.
- The python time method `ctime()` converts a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing local time. If secs is not provided or None, the current time as returned by time() is used. This function is equivalent to asctime(localtime(secs)).
- The `ntplib` module offers a simple interface to query NTP servers from Python. 
- Consequently The method `print_time` prints the time that is in the machine where the app is running.
- `if __name__ == “main”:` is used to execute some code <em>only if the file was run directly</em>, and not imported.
