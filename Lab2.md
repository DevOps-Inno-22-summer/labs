## Containerization

1. Create a `Dockerfile` for your application in `app_python` folder.
> Research and use best practices. Use linter for Dockerfile.
2. Write a DOCKER.md file and describe all best practices that you could find.
> The more practices you will list the more points you will get.
3. Build an image and test it, make sure it works!
4. Create a public `docker hub` account if you don't have. Push your image there.
5. Run the image from your account and test it.
6. Update README.md in your root folder. Add the `Docker` section.
> You can also check for README.md templates.
7. Create a commit and push it to your repository.


## Bonus

1. Create a `Dockerfile` for the app that you created in the previous lab.
2. Follow all steps and suggestions from the main task.
3. Read about `Docker multi-stage builds`. Implement, if it makes a sense only.
