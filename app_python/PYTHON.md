# Best pratices
- Use .gitignore to ensure that certain files we don't want to be tracked by Git remain untracked
- Python virtual environment for dependency management and project isolation
- The only route of the project is tested to ensure that it work properly

# Units testing best practices
- A single function is tested by each unit test
- Unit tests are isolated and can be run independently
- Unit tests assertions are small
- Unit tests are simple to understand
