  - Use PEP8 (Python Enhancement Proposals)
- Correct Broken Code Immediately
  - Always corrects bugs and defects before proceeding
- Use the Right Data Structures
- Write Readable Code
  - line breaks, code indentation, naming conventions, comments and whitespaces, maximum line length 79 characters
  - This is acheieved or supported by using a linter
- Use Virtual Environments
- Write Object-Oriented Code
- Avoid importing everything from a package
