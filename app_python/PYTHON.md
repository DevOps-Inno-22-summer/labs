# Best practices

1. Write test. Even better to start writing code from making tests first. TDD and BDD rules!
2. Stick to unified convention, which is commonly used by community
3. Use migrations for Database
4. Separate API endpoints and logic. Logic could be encapsulated into Services.
5. Use Static Analysis tools
6. Use Gateway or proxy, to get extra security layer for web application
