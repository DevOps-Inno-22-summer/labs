## Production ready framework and why I used FastAPI

Production readiness refers to when a certain application or a program will be ready to operate and be capable of handling production-level traffic, data and security. The application should be also available for all the intended users.

FastAPI framework is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It is easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production.

## Description of the best practices 
- Adding license file to the repo.
- Managing python dependency using virtual environment and using pip freeze command to generate a list of Python modules and packages installed in the virtual environment to requirements.txt file.
- Adding '.gitignore' file which specifies that git should ignore files that are local to a project.
- Managing the quality of the code I'm using pylint which is static analyzer tool that analyses the code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard (PEP 8), looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored
