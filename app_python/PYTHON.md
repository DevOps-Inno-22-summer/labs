Frameworks like `Django` and `Flask` can be used for a production environment, but flask is usually used for prototyping since it is easy to work with; however, flask is slow.

Also with `Flask`we have to use a lot of plugins to get a usual server functionality, that is a disadvantage.

`Django` is a [“batteries included”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batteries_Included) framework.

For familiarity, Flask was used to write this application. 

About Python best practices, we can say:

### The code: 
- It must do what it is supposed to do.
- It must not contain defects and problems.
- It must be easy to read, maintain, or extend.
