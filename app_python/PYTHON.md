# Framework

For this project, fastapi used, as it is claims that is

1. Faster than go and nodejs
2. Makes fewer bugs
3. Robust - it gives production ready code.
4. Short - minimized code

# Best practices:

1. Folder structure - folder structured as main.py outside which is the main file of the project and core folder to save models/schemas in future and also added settings.py file inside as there can be some settings and configurations, same variables without declaring everywhere in the apps to use. Also, tests folder to add tests in future.
2. Autopep8 - linter used for automatically formatting the code and make it up to PEP8 style guide.
3. Variable names - all variable names should be lower case with underscores separating words. snake_case used for variables and camel_case used for functions and classes.
