## How the application works for lab 1:

- `Flask` is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and  features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file.
- The python time method `ctime()` converts a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing local time. If secs is not provided or None, the current time as returned by time() is used. This function is equivalent to asctime(localtime(secs)).
- The `ntplib` module offers a simple interface to query NTP servers from Python. 
- Consequently The method `print_time` prints the time that is in the machine where the app is running.
- `if __name__ == “main”:` is used to execute some code <em>only if the file was run directly</em>, and not imported.
