# Lab 14

## Components of the stack and their purpose

- **The Prometheus Operator** -- automate and simplify the configuration of a Prometheus by stack monitoring for Kubernetes clusters.
- **Prometheus** -- collect metrics and store them in database.
- **Alertmanager** -- deduplicating, grouping, and routing alerts from an clients application (like the Prometheus server) to the receiver (like email, OpsGenie, PagerDuty).
- **Prometheus node-exporter** -- export hardware and OS metrics.
- **Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs** -- replace the metrics server on clusters that already run Prometheus. Adapt data for autoscaling/v2 Horizontal Pod Autoscaler in Kubernetes 1.6+.
- **kube-state-metrics** -- generating metrics from Kubernetes API objects without modification.
- **Grafana** -- visualization of the metrics.  

## kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc,cm

The command show information from the cluster about: pods, stateful sets, services, persistent volume claims and configmaps.

## Check how much CPU and Memory your StatefulSet is consuming.

## Check which Pod is using CPU more than others and which is less in the default namespace. Check how much memory is used on your node, in % and mb.

## Check how many pods and containers actually ran by the Kubelet service.

## Check which Pod is using network more than others and which is less in the default namespace.

## Check how many alerts you have. Also you can see them in the Web UI by the minikube service monitoring-kube-prometheus-alertmanager command.
