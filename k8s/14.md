# Expalantion of the components

- Prometheus Operator: It provides the deployment and management of Prometheus and other monitoring components on a kubernetes cluser. Prometheus Operator uses Kubernetes resources to deploy and manage Prometheus. It also allows to configure a monitoring target using Kuberenetes label queries.
- Highly available Prometheus: Prometheus stores time series (which are identified by metrics and a set of key-value pairs) in memory and in local disk, and it is highly available due to functional sharding.
- Highly available Alertmanager: It manages/inhibits alerts sent by application clients, and routes them to the correct receiver such as email.
- Prometheus node-exporter: It provided metrics related to kerenl and to hardware.
- Prometheus Adapter for Kuberenetes Metrics APIs: It is an adapter provides an implmentation of metrics provided by Kuberenetes API such as resource metrics, custom metrics, and external metrics APIs.
- kube-state-metrics: It collects metrics from the Kubernetes API server, the metrics are not focused on Kubernetes components, but related to objects inside the Kuberenetes clusters such as nodes, pods, and deployments.
- Grafana: It is a visulaization tool that allows to display different metrics gathered by other tools (such as Prometheus), and it helps to monotor and to analyze the collected data over a period of time.
