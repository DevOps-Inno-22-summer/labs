# Library Charts - Bonus

Library chart is used in order to create sample definitions which later can be reused through a number of different Helm charts. The examples are: Helper, Logic, Templates depends on what is required. As stated in helm website, this is used to support DRY principle and not to rewrite the things which are already written. As far as I understand this can be very iseful in case you have a bunch of mini services which have more or less similar helm files. You don't have to copy and paste it among ALL you applications. You will be able to use Library Chart for that and save more time on maintainance!
