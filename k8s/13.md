## Describe and explain in the report the differences between the output of the command for replicas
Each replica has its own independent state of visit.txt file. 

When we make a request to the cluster it chooses one replicas of our app and writes logs to independent, its own file. 

Thus, different replicas -- different files with different content.

## For our app ordering guarantee are unnecessary. Why?

Our replias are independent from each other, so ordering guarantee are unnecessary for our app.
