## Web application

Flask is a production ready web framework that is used in many industrial projects successfully.
It is a very simple framework and best suited to small projects. It's also relatively fast both in terms of execution and development time.

## Run
Go to the app_python folder and run `python -m flask run` which runs the applications.
You can then go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the web application browser.
